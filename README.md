# Fourier Audio Documentation

This repo contains the Docusaurus documentation which is shown at docs.fourieraudio.com.

In order to update the documentation, it is recommended that any updates are completed locally prior to a commit for PR. To build a local development setup:


## Install dependencies

```console
yarn
nodejs
```

## Clone the repo
```console
git clone git@github.com:fourieraudio/docs.git
```

## Install and start yarn when in the repo

```console
yarn install
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Commit any changes to git, and create a PR
