# MIDI

There are three ports on the back of the device provided for your convenience as MIDI connector
storage slots. If you have spare MIDI cables that you don't know what to do with, simply connect
them here.

In case that isn't what you wanted, actual MIDI functionality will be provided in the very near
future. If you have any thoughts or requests, please don't hesitate to email us at
[hello@fourieraudio.com](mailto:hello@fourieraudio.com)!

We are currently beta testing the **transform**.engine supporting MIDI program changes for Snapshot
recall functionality. This will be available very soon!
