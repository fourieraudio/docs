# Installation/Activation

The **transform**.client can be used to install and activate **transform**.suite onto a **transform**.engine, as well as to deactivate it from the engine if you wish to move it to another.

:::info
Please ensure that you are running v1.3 or newer (both client and engine firmware). You can download the latest version [here](../../../../downloads)
:::

## Installation & Activation

First, download the **transform**.suite collection file here:

<a class="button button--lg button--primary" href="../../../../../downloads/suitedownload">download transform.suite '25 collection file</a>
&nbsp;

:::info

It is approximately 4GB so may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection, but the good news is that you can keep this offline for whenever you may need it again!

If you haven't already, log in to the [Management Platform](../management-platform) and assign a licence to your **transform**.engine.

Then, using the **Plugin Collections** tab in **transform**.client, the process of installation and activation is incredibly simple.

Click **Upload & Activate Plugin Collection**, and select the `.collection` file you downloaded above.

From here, the installation and activation is completely automatic. It takes approximately 5-10 minutes.

:::note

The computer running **transform**.client must have internet access to activate the collection. It does not have to be a high bandwidth connection, and could be you tethered to your phone.

The **transform**.engine must be in **Setup** mode to install and activate the suite, and not be **Initialising** or **Offline**.

:::

## Deactivation

Deactivate **transform**.suite if you want to move your licence to a different engine.

First, ensure the engine is in either **Edit** or **Setup** mode (not **Initialising** or **Offline**), and has **transform**.suite is installed.

Then, simply click **Deactivate** in the Plugin Collections tab, and after approximately a minute, the licence will be deactivated. See further details about licence revocation on the [Licence Management Platform page](../management-platform).
