# Upgrading transform.suite


Suite '26 welcomes SoundTheory's Gullfoss Live, Eventide's Blackhole Immersive, standalone Slate Digital VMR modules, and expanded support for Touch & Turn. 
Plugin manufacturers regularly update their plugins to introduce new features and address compatibility with the latest host environments. Occasional updates from manufacturers may require a **transform**.suite update. If you encounter any issues after a plugin update, please reach out to our support team. We work closely with plugin manufacturers to implement new features and resolve any issues as quickly as possible. 

:::tip
Schedule upgrades during planned maintenance windows rather than *immediately* before a show!  
:::


## Before You Begin

- The system must remain powered on during the upgrade.
- The upgrade process takes around 10–15 minutes.
- Connect the client via the primary port if the unit has no other connections.

## Step-by-Step Upgrade Instructions

1. **Deactivate your existing Suite 25 licence** (internet-connected computer)
   - Open **transform**.client → Settings → **Plugin Collections** and deactivate your current Suite 25 licence.

2. **Obtain the Suite '26 licence** (there are two methods):
   - **In-place upgrade**
     - Log into your licence manager and select the **Upgrade** button next to the relevant licence. Credit calculations are applied automatically and any balance is paid by credit card.
   - **Redeem a licence or activation key**
     - If you have a redeem code or need to redeem online, go to: https://fourier.completeaccess.audio/redeem and follow the prompts.

3. **Assign the Suite 26 licence to an engine**
   - In your licence manager, assign the new Suite 26 licence to the desired engine.

4. **Download, install and activate Suite 26** (internet-connected computer)
   - In **transform**.client → Settings → **Plugin Collections** select and download the Suite 26 bundle, then install and activate it (one-click).

5. **Follow on-screen prompts and wait for the installation**
   - Installation typically takes around 5–10 minutes. The plugin scanner will pass through the collection twice.

6. **Confirm and enjoy**
   - Verify the installed plugins are appearing correctly, and enjoy your updated bundle!


## Accidental Upgrades
Accidentally upgraded the packages to suite '26 when you still only have a suite '25 licence? No need to reset your plugin host!
Simply select "Upload & Activate Plugin Collections" and upload the suite '25 `.collection` file.
