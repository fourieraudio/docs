# Updating transform.suite

Plugin manufacturers regularly update their plugins to introduce new features and address compatibility with the latest host environments. Occasional updates from manufacturers may require a **transform**.suite update. If you encounter any issues after a plugin update, please reach out to our support team we work closely with plugin manufacturers to implement new features and resolve any issues as quickly as possible.
