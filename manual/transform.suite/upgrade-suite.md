# Updating transform.suite


Suite '26 welcomes Sound Theory's Gullfoss Live, Eventide's Blackhole Immersive, standalone Slate Digital VMR modules, and expanded support for Touch & Turn. 
Plugin manufacturers regularly update their plugins to introduce new features and address compatibility with the latest host environments. Occasional updates from manufacturers may require a **transform**.suite update. If you encounter any issues after a plugin update, please reach out to our support team. We work closely with plugin manufacturers to implement new features and resolve any issues as quickly as possible.

Schedule upgrades during planned maintenance windows rather than *immediately* before a show!  
If you do not schedule maintenance, your equipment will do it for you...

3. **Assign the Suite 26 licence to an engine**
