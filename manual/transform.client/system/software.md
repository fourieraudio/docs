# Support & Software

Selecting the Support & Software tab, you'll find the **transform**.engine and **transform**.client version numbers of your system.

The **transform**.client software package very handily also contains the matching software for your
**transform**.engine. If your client has a new version of software for your **transform**.engine, it
will prompt you to upgrade your system to ensure maximum performance and compatibility!


There is also links to this manual, the email address to support, and an emergency help section for if you ever run into trouble!



### Log Files

Below that, you'll find the log file download buttons. Clicking 'Download Logs', will warn you that
you'll need to stop the audio engine to download them; if happy to proceed, hit continue and it will
prompt you to select a location to download them to. Selecting the client logs will open the relevant directory on your system, making it easy to locate and copy the files that support may need. 

:::note

Downloading logs can take 1-2 minutes.

These would be incredibly valuable to our amazing support team if you could attach them when contacting us with a problem!
