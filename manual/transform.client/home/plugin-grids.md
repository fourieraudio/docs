# Plugin Grids

Plugin grids let you get quick access to a pre-configured layout of specific
plugins from your show.

You can have as many plugin grids as you like, to allow you to configure your
showfile to match your workflow. Plugin grids can contain up to 6 plugins in
any layout you desire.

![Plugin Grid Example](/img/transformclient/grids-overview.png)

## Creating a plugin grid
To create a new plugin grid, hit <img src={addgrid} alt="Add plugin grid button" />
in the view controls menu on the left hand side of the screen when in the home
tab.

Once created, with the grid selected you can rename, renumber or delete the grid using the
action menu on the right hand side of the screen.

To pick your first plugin for the grid, press the button, and choose a plugin.
