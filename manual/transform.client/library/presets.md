# Presets

Presets allow you to save and recall specific plugin configurations across your showfile.  
Managing presets happens directly within the **Library** tab giving you a central place to keep your favourite plugin setups organised, renamed, and easily shared.

Preset states are updated across cues, so saving your preset in `Cue 1` updates the same value in `Cue 99`! 




## Managing Presets

Within the **Library** tab, when you select a plugin, you’ll find the **Preset Manager**.  
This allows you to:

- **Select a preset** - highlight any preset in the list to make it active.  
- **Rename a preset** - change the displayed name to something more meaningful.  
- **Import preset** - load a preset previously exported from another showfile.  
- **Export preset** - save a presets for backup or transfer.
- **Delete preset** - Remove a preset from the showfile.




## Renaming

You can rename a preset at any time by selecting it in the list and choosing the **Rename** buttons.

Renumbering helps keep your presets tidy when creating multiple versions of similar configurations.  
If a preset number is already taken, the system will automatically shift other presets up to avoid conflicts.

## Importing & Exporting

Presets are stored as lightweight files, meaning they can be easily shared between clients or imported into another showfile.

- **Import** - choose a `.state` preset file from your **transform**.client device to add it to your Library.  
- **Export** - save the selected preset as a `.state` file for safekeeping or transfer.  

This workflow allows you to maintain a consistent sound setup across different engines or shows!



## Quick Tips

- Keep preset names clear and descriptive (e.g. “Vocal Comp v2” or “Drum Bus Glue”).  
- Use numbering to order presets logically.
- All preset changes are require manual saving in the detail pane to impact your showfile.
