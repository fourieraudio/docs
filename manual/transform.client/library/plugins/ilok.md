As the Windows environment cannot access the internet, iLok protected plugins must be activated using a physical iLok connected to the **transform**.engine.

### iLok Licensing for Plugins

A number of plugin manufacturers use iLok for plugin licensing. We've put a guide below to get you up to speed.

For plugin manufacturer specific licensing, find them [here](manufacturers/index.md).

How to license your **iLok** protected plugins on the **transform**.engine:

- **Software Required:** [iLok License Manager](https://www.ilok.com/#!license-manager)
- **iLok Support Website:** [iLok Support](https://help.ilok.com/)
- **Hardware Required:** iLok USB key

1. On your personal device, download the iLok License Manager software.
2. Upon launch, select sign in (you will need to be connected to the internet), if you have an iLok account already, sign in here. If you are a new user, select 'Create New Account' and follow the registration steps.

For licenses to appear in your account, there are several methods:

**Method 1**:
Your user ID will be used by manufacturers when purchasing plugins to deposit the licenses directly into your account.

**Method 2**:
Upon purchase, manufacturers will give you an 'Activation Code', this can be redeemed in iLok License Manager, under 'Licenses' menu and select 'Redeem Activation Code'. The license will then appear in your account.

**Method 3**:
Certain manufacturers allow the transfer of licenses from iLok account to iLok account at a cost of
$25 per transfer. To quickly identify if a plugin license is allowed to be transferred, select the
license and in the details window, you will see 'Allow Transfer', yes or no. If allowed, right click
and select 'Transfer License' and follow the necessary steps.

3. Plug your iLok USB key into your personal device, if it hasn't been registered to your account already, select 'Yes' when prompted.
4. Select plugins from your account, right click and select activate.
5. Choose desired iLok to activate licenses on and confirm. Your iLok is good to go!
6. Remove it from your personal device and plug it into your **transform**.engine.

### Internal iLok

Fourier Audio uses iLok to protect our intellectual property. Inside each **transform**.engine
you'll find an iLok to license our software. The removal of this iLok will result in the end of the
world/(**transform**.engine will stop working)!!
