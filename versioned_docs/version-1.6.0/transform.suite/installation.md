# Installation/Activation

The **transform**.client can be used to install and activate **transform**.suite onto a **transform**.engine, as well as to deactivate it from the engine if you wish to move it to another.

:::info
Please ensure that you are running v1.3 or newer (both client and engine firmware). You can download the latest version [here](../../../../downloads)
:::

## Installation & Activation

First, download the **transform**.suite collection file here:

<a class="button button--lg button--primary" href="../../../../../downloads/suitedownload">download transform.suite '26 collection file</a>
&nbsp;

:::info

It is approximately 4.7GB so may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection, but the good news is that you can keep this offline for whenever you may need it again!

### Legacy Version

<a class="button button--lg button--primary" href="https://downloads.fourieraudio.com/transform/suite/25/fa-plugin-collection-transform.suite-25-bundle_1.1.0.collection">download **transform**.suite '25 collection file</a>

If you haven't already, log in to the [Management Platform](../management-platform) and assign a licence to your **transform**.engine.

Then, using the **Plugin Collections** tab in **transform**.client, the process of installation and activation is incredibly simple.

Click **Upload & Activate Plugin Collection**, and select the `.collection` file you downloaded above.

From here, the installation and activation is completely automatic. It takes approximately 5-10 minutes.

:::note

The computer running **transform**.client must have internet access to activate the collection. It does not have to be a high bandwidth connection, and could be you tethered to your phone.

The **transform**.engine must be in **Setup** mode to install and activate the suite, and not be **Initialising** or **Offline**.

:::

## Deactivation

Deactivate **transform**.suite if you want to move your licence to a different engine.

First, ensure the engine is in either **Edit** or **Setup** mode (not **Initialising** or **Offline**), and has **transform**.suite is installed.

Then, simply click **Deactivate** in the Plugin Collections tab, and after approximately a minute, the licence will be deactivated. See further details about licence revocation on the [Licence Management Platform page](../management-platform).
