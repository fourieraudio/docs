# Transform User Manual

Welcome to the Fourier Audio **transform**.engine manual!

You'll find everything you need to set up, configure, and install plugins, plus some tips and tricks along the way.

We've hopefully covered everything you need, but if we have missed something, please don't hesitate
to send us an email on [hello@fourieraudio.com](mailto:hello@fourieraudio.com), and we'll be sure to
add it. Or even better - you can click 'Edit Page' on any page to raise a Pull Request on GitHub.
Don't worry - nothing will update until we've checked it out.

## Plugin Installation

Go directly to our handy guides for installing plugins. Do not pass 'go', do not collect $200!
