# Installation Guide

### What will I need in order to get started with the **transform**.engine?

You will need:

- At least one **transform**.engine (:wink:).
- One or more Dante-enabled devices to patch the engine to.
- A computer to run the **transform**.client control software and Dante Controller, running either Windows (10 upwards) or macOS (Intel and M1+). Once set up, your computer isn't required for running!

For step-by-step instructions, read the [getting started guide](../getting-started.md).
