# FAQs

### Once I have bought the **transform**.suite, how do I activate it?
Download the **transform**.suite ’25 collection file ([download here](https://go.fourieraudio.com/suite-download)) and upload it to your **transform**.engine using the **transform**.client. See our [quick-start](../quick-start) guide for more information!

### How many **transform**.engines can use a single transform.suite licence?
A **transform**.suite licence can be activated on one **transform**.engine at a time: but you can move **transform**.suite licences between engines any time via our [online platform](../management-platform).

### Can I move **transform**.suite activations between **transform**.engines?
Yes! You are able to simply transfer your licences between **transform**.engines using our [online platform](../management-platform).

### Can I still install other plugins on top of the **transform**.suite?
Yes! You can do this as you normally would on the **transform**.engine.

### Can I use **transform**.suite on another platform?
**transform**.suite ’25 is exclusive for **transform**.engine and cannot be transferred onto any other device or computer.

### Do I need the internet to install **transform**.suite?
The computer running **transform**.client needs a low-bandwidth internet connection to activate your **transform**.suite licence. An internet connection is not required to download or install **transform**.suite: you can download the collection file at any time ([download here](https://go.fourieraudio.com/suite-download)), and store that offline, ready for when you need it. The **transform**.engine remains offline at all times; only the computer running **transform**.client requires internet access.
