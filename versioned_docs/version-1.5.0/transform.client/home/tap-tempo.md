# Tap Tempo

:::tip
By default, your plugin is disconnected from the global tap tempo, use the **Connect** button in the plugin detail pane to connect your plugin to the global tap tempo.
:::

For tap tempo, you can use the conveniently named 'Tap' button in the top bar! (Who'd have **thunk** it?).

Alternatively you can click the numerical value and type in your **favourite** BPM/ whatever BPM the drummer is going for today, or use the space bar on your keyboard to *tappy tap tap* your beat in.
