# Unsupported Plugins

The **transform**.engine aims to support any Windows 10 compatible plugin that can be installed and
activated offline. The Windows plugin hosting environment has no internet access to ensure it
remains pristine, reliable, and show-ready.

Unfortunately, a small number of manufacturers currently do not support offline licensing. Whilst we're working hard to find solutions for these, at the moment, the plugins from these manufacturers cannot be installed on the **transform**.engine:

- Baby Audio- however 'Spaced Out', 'Parallel Aggressor' and 'Crystalline' plugins are available through the **transform**.suite, for more info click [here](https://fourieraudio.com/suite)!
- Cradle
- GS DSP

If you find any more manufacturers that do not support offline licensing, or experience problems with installing plugins, please do reach out to our support team on [support@fourieraudio.com](mailto:support@fourieraudio.com)
