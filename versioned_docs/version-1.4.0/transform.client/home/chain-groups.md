# Chain Groups

Chain groups allow you sort and filter your chains for quicker navigation in large showfiles.

## Creating a chain group

To create a chain group, either click <img src={addgroup} alt="Add group button" /> in the view controls menu on the left hand side of the screen when in the home tab. Alternatively, when adding a chain to a group, press:

<img src={addgroupInline} alt="Inline add group button" />

Once created, with the group selected you can rename, renumber or delete the chain group
using the action menu on the right hand side of the screen.

## Adding or removing chains from a group

To modify the groups to which a chain is assigned, select the chain and use the picker in
the detail pane at the bottom of the screen:

Selecting `Change` allows you to change the group assignment:

## Viewing chains in a group

To quickly view the chains assigned to a group, select that group in the view controls menu:

To return to seeing all chains, select <img src={allChains} alt="All Chains button" /> or hit the <img src={homeTab} alt="Home Tab" /> tab.
