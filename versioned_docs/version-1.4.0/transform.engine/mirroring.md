# Mirroring

The **transform**.engine currently doesn't support mirroring between two units just yet, but we definitely have plans to. 

We are currently in the process of designing and implementing it with a very fine tooth comb to make sure it's everything you'd expect, and more!  

Please check out our [roadmap](https://docs.fourieraudio.com/roadmap/), for when to expect it. 

For now, we understand that some users will want to take a back up **transform**.engine out on the road with them. 

In this instance, we would recommend exporting the showfile from your main unit, and importing it to the back up unit at the start of the day/show (or at more regular intervals if your heart desires). 

At this point, the **transform**.engines would have exactly same settings. Whilst any changes made after this point would lead them to be out of sync, it would hopefully only be minor changes and you would roughly be in the same ball park.
