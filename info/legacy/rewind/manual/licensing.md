# Licensing

## Overview

Rewind is available in three different editions, which differ only in the number of channels they
can process:

| Edition | Channels | RTA |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Personal | 16 | No |
| Professional | 64 | Yes |
| Production | 128 (wow!) | Yes |

To protect your investment, guard against intellectual property theft, and safeguard our
R&D for the future, we use the *iLok* dongle system to license Rewind. You will need an iLok 2 or
iLok 3 to run *Rewind*.

We chose *iLok* because we know many engineers will have one already, but if you don't, they can be
obtained cheaply from your favourite rainforest-related eCommerce provider, or alternatively
*Fourier Audio* can provide pre-licensed dongles ready for use.

The first time you start *Fourier Rewind*, you'll be prompted to insert your *iLok* and
enter your activation code to obtain your licence. After that, you should never need to think about
it ever again; the licence simply lives on your *iLok*.

All three editions run via the same *Rewind* application; if you find you need more channels, simply
upgrade your licence - mid-gig if necessary! Upgrade pricing [is
available](mailto:hello@fourieraudio.com).

## *iLok* Login Details

You will be required to have an *iLok* account linked to your physical *iLok*.

If this is your first time using an *iLok*, you can create an *iLok* account on PACE's website [here](https://www.ilok.com/#!registration).

During account creation, you will create a User ID - this is the User ID that allows us to deliver your *Rewind* licence to your account.

Forgotten your User ID? Visit [PACE Support](https://www.ilok.com/#!support/help/102029545) for further assistance.

## Activating Your *Rewind* Licence

When you begin a *Rewind* trial, or purchase a *Rewind* licence, you will be asked for your User ID. This will enable us to deposit your licence magically into your *iLok* account, ready for activation onto your physical *iLok*.

Once deposited to your account, in order to activate your licence:
1. Launch *iLok* License Manager (installed with *Rewind* if you don't already have it)
2. Login to your *iLok* account
3. Plug in your physical *iLok* (that is linked to that *iLok* account)
4. Drag your *Rewind* licence to your *iLok* (shown in the left hand column of the screen)

## Got a problem?

In the first instance, take a read of the [PACE *iLok* support site](https://www.ilok.com/#!support) for all *iLok* related licensing issues.

If you're still not successful, please drop us an email at [support@fourieraudio.com](mailto:support@fourieraudio.com) and we'll get you up and running in no time.
