# Plugin Database

With so many plugins in the world, we are actively testing new plugins as we come across them to
verify compatibility and find any issues from the safety of the lab, rather than on a gig!

It's why we have built a dedicated Fourier Audio **transform**.engine Plugin Database of all the plugins we've tested.

As you can imagine, this is an endless task and whilst we have tried to include and test as many as possible already, there are always more to test!
If there's a plugin you're interested in we haven't tested yet, feel free to submit it [here](https://82a5cty9u25.typeform.com/to/uZgxh9kH). We love finding new plugins and we will be more than happy to test it for you!

You can find the database of test results at:
