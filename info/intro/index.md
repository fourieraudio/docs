# Introduction

The **transform**.engine is a 2U low latency, reliable plugin host, with the ability to host Windows 10 compatible VST3 plugins that can be installed and licensed offline.
It offers 64x64 channels of audio via Dante at sample rates up to 96 kHz (44.1 kHz and 48 kHz supported). The **transform**.engine runs a realtime Linux kernel for system processing and provides an isolated Windows 10 environment for plugin hosting.

The **transform**.engine provides an open platform for all plugin manufacturers, big or small, to run their plugins on a secure and reliable platform!

Utilising patent-pending technology to individually process each plugin chain, in the unlikely scenario that a plugin crashes, not only will the **transform**.engine automatically reboot the plugin (depending on the plugin, often in a matter of samples rather than seconds), without user input. Your other plugin chains will be unaffected!

As **transform**.engine operates as a server, the **transform**.client software on your computer is purely a client that connects to it over the network; only control data flows between the **transform**.engine and your computer - if the connection is lost, audio remains uninterrupted.

We offer **transform**.client for both macOS (Intel and M1+) and Windows computers. We also support multiple clients: numerous computers running the **transform**.client software can connect to the same **transform**.engine simultaneously, with each client being able to edit their own plugins at the same time!
