# Roadmap

While we don't have a crystal ball, we do at least have a good idea of what's coming next for the **transform**.engine. Here we will list the most-asked-for features, and give you a rough idea of timeline on when to expect them to hit a **transform**.engine near you.

We share this with the caveat that it is very much subject to change, in no small part based on the
feedback we receive from our ~~adoring fans~~ users.

| Feature Ref. | Feature Details                                                                                                                           | Planned For   |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| TF-157       | Chain Groups - ways to slice and dice your chains. | End of 2024 |
| FA-598       | Initial console integration - control your plugins from a console! | End of 2024 |
| TF-1659      | Network Redundancy - mirror two **transform**.engines so that they can be used in a redundant configuration.                              | 2025          |
