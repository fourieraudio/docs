- **transform**.engine **version**: `1.6.0`
- **Windows** **transform**.client **version**: `1.6.0`
- **macOS** **transform**.client **version**: `1.6.0`

## Summary
[//]: <> (I will be very upset if anyone removes the joke)
* **🍬 transform.suite '26**: Think '25 was *suite enough*? Suite '26 welcomes Sound Theory's Gullfoss Live, Eventide's Blackhole Immersive , Slate Digitals VMR Standalones, and plenty of updates to Touch & Turn!
* **🎨 Presets**: Easily store and reuse plugin settings across multiple chains or cues, even for plugins with no internal presets.
* **💻 Type In Plugins**: Keyboard input gets teleported into your plugins, you can now type and pass modifier keys into plugins when using plugin view.
* **📈 More Period Sizes**: Your transform's now have 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 sample period sizes, giving you even more flexibility when balancing latency and DSP!



And many more delightful improvements to the **transform** world!


## New In This Release

## Compatibility Notes
Showfiles are fully backwards and forwards compatible with **transform**.engine v1.1-v1.5.

**transform**.engine v1.6 is fully backwards compatible with **transform**.client v1.0-v1.5, and vice-versa; you can connect to an engine running v1.5 from a client running v1.6, and to an engine running v1.6 from a client running v1.5.

Downgrading to versions prior to v1.6 is currently not possible once v1.6 has been installed.

## Known Issues
Users should be aware of the following known issue in this release, which we hope to address in a future update:

- **TF-2749**: A bug in macOS 15.2-15.4.1 causes macOS to block “Local Network” access for apps after reboot until manually enabled again in Settings. We can confirm that this is fixed in macOS 15.6.1.
- **TF-2698**: When bx_limiter and AMEK EQ 200 are used in a chain, recalling cues can cause a momentary increase in DSP load. We are working with the plugin publisher to resolve this issue.
- **TF-3434**: It is possible for multiple network interfaces to be configured with overlapping subnets via DHCP, causing IP network issues.


A small number of plugins may experience compatibility issues running on **transform**.engine. For details, see our plugin compatibility database at [https://plugins.fourieraudio.com](https://plugins.fourieraudio.com) .
