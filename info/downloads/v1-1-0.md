# transform.engine v1.1.0 release notes

- **Engine Version**: `1.1.0`
- **Windows Client Version**: `1.1.0`
- **macOS Client Version**: `1.1.0`

## Summary

This is a bugfix release, intended to improve general happiness and resolve several critical issues
you may experience using **transform**.engine.

We strongly encourage all users to update to this fully backwards-compatible release immediately.

## Bugs Fixed In This Release

* TF-1847: Plugin data can fail to save after loading a showfile
* TF-1686: Connecting the client to the **transform**.engine using a link-local address results in
  “heartbeat stalled”’; no metering or teleport
* TF-1696: Certain plugins may lead to incorrectly excessive DSP load being displayed
* TF-1345: Chain metering freezes whilst that chain restarts
* TF-1279: Certain plugin controls cannot be used
* TF-1857: **transform**.client: Some IP addresses could not be input
* TF-1784, TF-1835, TF-1845, TF-1860: **transform**.client does not always reliably reconnect to
  engine, leading to “heartbeat stalled” or “cannot submit command to director”
* TF-1673: System status indicators are occasionally inaccurate
* TF-1753: Improve plugin loading time, prevent unnecessary reloads if latency has not changed
* TF-1849: **transform**.client: Prevent crashes in certain pathological cases
* TF-1718, TF-1752, TF-1787: **transform**.client: Accessibility / keyboard navigation improvements
* TF-1685, TF-1786: **transform**.client: System status view clipped on small screens
* TF-1695, TF-1876: **transform**.client: Performance improvements
* TF-1815: Dante (DEP) upgrade to v1.3.3.5, improving PTP lock reliability, preventing mDNS traffic
  from leaking onto the control network, and addressing an issue where switching sample rate would
  result in incorrect latency values in Dante Controller.

## New In This Release
* TF-1781: Dante network latencies above 2 ms now supported in 32 sample-per-buffer mode
* TF-1803: **transform**.client: Simplify showfile save operations under “Save Copy” action
* TF-1809: **transform**.client: Make it really obvious that resetting the plugin host to its
  factory settings will reset the plugin host to its factory settings
* TF-1877: Plugin compatibility database update
* TF-17: Display audio renderer performance statistics
* TF-1100: **transform**.client: Make scrollbars more obvious

## Compatibility Notes
Showfiles saved in engine v1.0 can be freely loaded into an engine running v1.1. Once a showfile has
been loaded in engine v1.1, it cannot be subsequently loaded into an engine running v1.0. We
apologise for the inconvenience; it is our aim in general for showfiles to be backwards-compatible
where possible.

**transform**.engine v1.1 is otherwise fully backwards compatible with **transform**.client v1.0, and
vice-versa; you can connect to an engine running v1.0 from a client running v1.1, and to an engine
running v1.1 from a client running v1.0.

## Known Issues

Users should be aware of the following [known issues](/manual/known-issues) in this release, which
we hope to address in a future update:

* TF-944: Dante Secondary interface is only operational when using DHCP or Static IP addressing
* TF-1891: DSP load meter occasionally jumps to 100%
* TF-1810: Plugin scanner can stall showing spinner

For more details and workarounds for these issues, see the [known issues list](/manual/known-issues).

A small number of plugins may experience compatibility issues running on transform.engine.
