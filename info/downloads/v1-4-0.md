## Bugs Fixed In This Release

- **TF-2746**: Some installed Waves programs could interfere with **transform**.suite installation.

## Compatibility Notes

Showfiles are fully backwards- and forwards-compatible with transform.engine v1.1-v1.3.

**transform**.engine v1.4 is fully backwards compatible with transform.client v1.0-v1.3, and vice-versa; you can connect to an engine running v1.3 from a client running v1.4, and to an engine running v1.4 from a client running v1.3.

Downgrading to versions prior to v1.4 is currently not possible once v1.4 has been installed.

## Known Issues

Users should be aware of the following known issue in this release, which we hope to address in a future update:

- **TF-2749**: A bug in macOS 15.2 and 15.3.1 causes macOS to block ‚ÄúLocal Network‚Äù access for apps after reboot until manually enabled again in Settings. We are awaiting a fix from Apple.  
- **TF-2148**: When **transform**.engine is the PTP clock leader on boot, changing the sample rate from 96 kHz to 48 kHz in Dante Controller can result in the Dante audio transport stalling. Restarting the **transform**.engine after changing sample rate resolves the issue.  
- **TF-2698**: When bx\_limiter and AMEK EQ 200 are used in a chain, recalling cues can cause a momentary increase in DSP load.  
- **TF-1778**: It is possible to configure both the Primary and Control networks to be Link Local, causing IP network issues.  
- **TF-1779**: It is possible to configure multiple network interfaces with overlapping Static IP subnets, causing IP network issues.

A small number of plugins may experience compatibility issues running on **transform**.engine. For details, see our plugin compatibility database at [https://plugins.fourieraudio.com](https://plugins.fourieraudio.com) .
