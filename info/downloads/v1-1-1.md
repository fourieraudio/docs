# transform.engine v1.1.1 release notes

- **Engine Version**: `1.1.0`
- **Windows Client Version**: `1.1.1`
- **macOS Client Version**: `1.1.1`

## Summary

This is a bugfix **transform**.client patch release; for details of the newest improvements, see
[v1.1.0](v1-1-0.md)!

## Bugs Fixed In This Release

1. **TF-1959, TF-1960, TF-1961: transform.client performance regression on showfiles with many chains**

  We discovered a performance regression in **transform**.client v1.1.0. In particularly demanding
  showfiles containing lots of chains, the UI could:

  - take a very long time to display data from the **transform**.engine, resulting in loaded showfiles
    appearing to be empty
  - be very slow to respond to user input
  - display "teleporter resting" instead of showing a plugin in plugin view

  This issue was discovered in the field post-release. Following beta-testing with affected users,
  we believe the regression introduced in v1.1.0 is resolved by this release.

We recommend that all users upgrade to this release.

## Compatibility Notes
This release introduces no compatibility changes from [v1.1.0](v1-1-0.md).

Showfiles saved in engine v1.0 can be freely loaded into an engine running v1.1. Once a showfile has
been loaded in engine v1.1, it cannot be subsequently loaded into an engine running v1.0. We
apologise for the inconvenience; it is our aim in general for showfiles to be backwards-compatible
where possible.

**transform**.engine v1.1 is otherwise fully backwards compatible with **transform**.client v1.0, and
vice-versa; you can connect to an engine running v1.0 from a client running v1.1, and to an engine
running v1.1 from a client running v1.0.

## Known Issues

Users should be aware of the following [known issues](/manual/known-issues) in this release, which
we hope to address in a future update:

* TF-944: Dante Secondary interface is only operational when using DHCP or Static IP addressing
* TF-1891: DSP load meter occasionally jumps to 100%
* TF-1810: Plugin scanner can stall showing spinner

For more details and workarounds for these issues, see the [known issues list](/manual/known-issues).

A small number of plugins may experience compatibility issues running on transform.engine.
