# transform.engine v1.2.0 release notes

- **Engine Version**: `1.2.0`
- **Windows Client Version**: `1.2.0`
- **macOS Client Version**: `1.2.0`

## Summary

We‚Äôre excited to release **transform**.engine v1.2, featuring:

* **üî• Store and recall plugin data in Cuelists:** store and recall Cues, which snapshot the entire state of all currently loaded plugins
* **ü§ñ MIDI Control:** use MIDI to fire Cues
* **‚è∞ 512-sample periods:** for latency-hungry plugins

‚Ä¶as well as a number of other goodies and bugfixes.

We encourage all users to update to this fully backwards-compatible release as soon as possible.

## New In This Release

- **TF-90: Record and Fire Cues**: It is now possible to record and fire Cues, which snapshot the
  entire state of all currently loaded plugins. [read more](../../manual/transform.client/cuelists)
- **TF-70, TF-156: Create Cuelists with Recall Filters**: It is now possible to create multiple
  Cuelists, each of which can be filtered to affect different chains when Cues in the list are
  recalled by different clients. [read more](../../manual/transform.client/cuelists/filters)
- **TF-98: Copy & paste plugin states**: there are now buttons in the detail pane for a plugin
  instance which allow you to copy and paste the state of a plugin between instances of the same
  plugin type
- **TF-100: Fire Cues via MIDI**: You can now send MIDI messages to the transform.engine which will
  cause a Cue to be fired. [read more](../../manual/transform.engine/midi)
- TF-944: Link-Local IP addressing is now supported on the Dante Secondary interface
- TF-1946: 512-sample periods are now available, supporting processing of plugins which require that much latency
- TF-2093: Maximised plugin view mode, helping you see more plugin on small screens
- TF-2113: Delete operations now require confirmation
- TF-2029: Move chains left and right
- TF-2048: Re-number chains
- TF-1804: Rename showfiles
- TF-1897, TF-2075: Bypass and Smite buttons are now more obvious when selected, along with other toggle buttons

## Bugs Fixed In This Release

- TF-1893: Plugins could show as offline for extended periods of time when loading chains when different chains were previously loaded  
- TF-1810: Plugin scanner can show endless spinner
- TF-1919: Improve chain startup times
- TF-1902: Selecting current period size causes renderer to restart
- TF-2139: Plugin host access handshake is now unique per-device
- TF-2232: After loading hundreds of showfiles, further loads could have no effect
- TF-2212: Latency group changes made by one client not shown on others
- TF-2181: **transform**.client: Disconnection warning could occasionally flicker into view
- TF-1970: **transform**.client: Improve performance by fiddling with scrollbar implementation

## Compatibility Notes
This release introduces no compatibility changes from [v1.1.0](v1-1-0.md).

Showfiles are fully backwards- and forwards-compatible with transform.engine v1.1.

transform.engine v1.2 is fully backwards compatible with transform.client v1.0-v1.1, and vice-versa;
you can connect to an engine running v1.1 from a client running v1.2, and to an engine running v1.2
from a client running v1.1.

## Known Issues

Users should be aware of the following [known issues](/manual/known-issues) in this release, which
we hope to address in a future update:

- TF-1891: DSP load meter can occasionally jump to 100% load, before returning to normal. We believe
  these occasional jumps are spurious and can be safely ignored.
- TF-2148: When **transform**.engine is the PTP clock leader, changing the sample rate from 96 kHz
  to 48 kHz in Dante Controller can result in the Dante audio transport stalling if transform.engine
  is the PTP clock leader. Restarting the **transform**.engine after changing sample rate resolves
  the issue.

For more details and workarounds for these issues, see the [known issues list](/manual/known-issues).

A small number of plugins may experience compatibility issues running on transform.engine.
