# transform.engine v1.3.1 release notes

- **Engine Version**: `1.3.0`
- **Windows Client Version**: `1.3.1`
- **macOS Client Version**: `1.3.1`

## Summary

This is a bugfix **transform**.client patch release; for details of the newest
improvements, see [v1.3.0](v1-3-0.md)!

## Bugs Fixed In This Release

1. **TF-2723: engine upgrade not offered for some factory-fresh units**

  We discovered that in v1.3.0, **transform**.client would fail to offer the
  mandatory upgrade for **transform**.engines delivered from the factory
  running software versions v0.0.11 or v0.0.12 due to an issue with the
  communication protocol used by those versions (only), preventing those
  engines from being used.

  This v1.3.1 release of **transform**.client resolves the issue, meaning that
  all engines can be successfully upgraded. There is no change to the engine software
  in this release, which remains at v1.3.0.

We recommend that all users upgrade to this release.

## Compatibility Notes
This release introduces no compatibility changes from [v1.3.0](v1-3-0.md).

## Known Issues

Users should be aware of the following [known issues](/manual/known-issues) in this release, which
we hope to address in a future update:

- TF-2148: When **transform**.engine is the PTP clock leader on boot, changing the sample rate from 96 kHz to 48 kHz in Dante Controller can result in the Dante audio transport stalling. Restarting the **transform**.engine after changing sample rate resolves the issue.
- TF-2698: When bx\_limiter or AMEK EQ 200 are used in a chain, recalling cues can cause a momentary increase in DSP load.

For more details and workarounds for these issues, see the [known issues list](/manual/known-issues).

A small number of plugins may experience compatibility issues running on transform.engine.
