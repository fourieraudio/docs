# transform.engine v1.3.0 Release Notes

- **transform**.engine **Version**: `1.3.0`
- **Windows transform**.client **Version:** `1.3.0`
- **macOS transform**.client **Version**: `1.3.0`

## Summary

We‚Äôre very excited to release **transform**.engine v1.3, featuring:

* **üî• transform**.suite: Get the world‚Äôs best plugins for live in a single click.
* **üëè CLAP**: Use plugins which support this modern open audio plugin standard.

‚Ä¶as well as a number of other exciting treats and bugfixes.

We encourage all users to update to this fully backwards-compatible release as soon as possible.

## New In This Release

- TF-2311: **transform**.suite \- install and licence the **transform**.suite plugin collection with a single click from **transform**.client.
- TF-1721: CLAP plugin support \- plugins using the CLAP standard can now be used, as well as VST3 plugins.
- TF-2351: Multiple clients can now view the same plugin at once
- TF-888: Scroll around plugin UIs when they exceed the maximum supported size \- previously, it could be hard to resize plugins if you set them to be bigger than the maximum supported size, because often the plugin resize UI would be clipped off. Now you can scroll around the plugin UI to avoid this.
- TF-1852: Dim the OLED Display when not in use \- some devices were exhibiting burn-in on their OLED display: dimming the display will reduce the rate of burn-in.
- TF-2643: Update PACE License Support and iLok License Manager to 5.10.0

## Compatibility Notes

Showfiles are fully backwards- and forwards-compatible with transform.engine v1.1 and v1.2.

transform.engine v1.3 is fully backwards compatible with transform.client v1.0-v1.2, and vice-versa; you can connect to an engine running v1.2 from a client running v1.3, and to an engine running v1.3 from a client running v1.2.

Downgrading to versions prior to v1.3 is currently not possible once v1.3 has been installed.

## Known Issues

Users should be aware of the following known issues in this release, which we hope to address in a future update:

- TF-2148: When **transform**.engine is the PTP clock leader on boot, changing the sample rate from 96 kHz to 48 kHz in Dante Controller can result in the Dante audio transport stalling. Restarting the **transform**.engine after changing sample rate resolves the issue.
- TF-2698: When bx\_limiter or AMEK EQ 200 are used in a chain, recalling cues can cause a momentary increase in DSP load.

A small number of plugins may experience compatibility issues running on **transform**.engine. For details, see our plugin compatibility database at [https://plugins.fourieraudio.com](https://plugins.fourieraudio.com) .
