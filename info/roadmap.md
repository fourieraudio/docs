# Roadmap

While we don't have a crystal ball, we do at least have a good idea of what's coming next for the **transform**.engine. Here we will list the most-asked-for features, and give you a rough idea of timeline on when to expect them to hit a **transform**.engine near you.

We share this with the caveat that it is very much subject to change, in no small part based on the
feedback we receive from our ~~adoring fans~~ users.

| Feature Ref. | Feature Details                                                                                                                           | Planned For   |

| TF-137        | Detailed Performance Info - understand which chains and plugins are consuming DSP resources | Summer 2025 |

| TF-78        | Network Redundancy - mirror two **transform**.engines so that they can be used in a redundant configuration                              | 2026 |
