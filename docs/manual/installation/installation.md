# Installation Guide

### What will I need in order to get started with the **transform**.engine?

You will need:

- At least one **transform**.engine (:wink:).
- One or more Dante-enabled devices to patch the engine to.
- A computer to run the **transform**.client control software and Dante Controller, running either Windows (10 upwards) or macOS (Intel and M1+). Once set up, your computer isn't required for running!

### Configuring the IP address of the **transform**.engine

Using the OLED display on the front of the unit, you can configure the IP address for the Dante Control, Primary and Secondary connections.
For more details on this, see [here](../transform.engine/oled).

:::warning

Please note that at this time, the **transform**.client must be connected by either a static or DHCP IP address - **not link-local**; see [known issue TF-1686](../known-issues).
This will be resolved in a future release.
