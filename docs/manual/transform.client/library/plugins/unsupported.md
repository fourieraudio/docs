# Unsupported Plugins

The **transform**.engine aims to support any Windows 10 compatible plugin that can be installed and
activated offline. The Windows plugin hosting environment has no internet access to ensure it
remains pristine reliable, end show-ready.

Unfortunately, a small number of manufacturers currently do not support a fully-offline installation
process. Whilst we're working hard to find solutions for these, at the moment plugins from these
manufacturers cannot be installed on the **transform**.engine.

Plugin manufacturers that require online installation:

- Universal Audio

Plugin Manufacturers that require online activation/licensing:

- Baby Audio
- Antares
- Cradle
- GS DSP

:::info

Instruments and multi-channel only (i.e. plugins that require 3+ inputs/outputs) are not supported at this time. Stay tuned!
