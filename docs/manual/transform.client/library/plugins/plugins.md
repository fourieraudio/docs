# Plugins

The MVP of the **transform**.engine, plugins!

Here you'll find handy guides on how to install and license a number of different manufacturers plugins.

Whilst we've sought to include a large and varied list of manufacturers, if you think we have missed someone, let us know on [hello@fourieraudio.com](mailto:hello@fourieraudio.com)!

## House Recommendations

### OpenGL

Whilst some plugin manufacturers use OpenGL, for optimum performance on the **transform**.engine, we recommend disabling OpenGL graphics when you can.

### VSTi

Whilst we support VST3s, your VSTis won't get past our plugin scanner, sorry. They run a tight ship, and if your name isn't VST3, you're not getting in.

### Multi-channel

Whilst we support mono and stereo plugin chains, we currently don't support any larger channel widths than this for now (but trust it is on our to-do list).
