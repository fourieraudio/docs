# transform.client

Welcome to the **transform**.client!
Click [here](/downloads) to download the latest **transform**.client software.

Deliberately designed to be simple, we want to get you up and running in next to no time.

Split into three tabs:

1. Accessible at the top left: [**Home**](home) - Build your plugin chains.
2. Next door to Home: [**Library**](library) - Your toolbox, add and remove plugins.
3. Top right corner: [**System**](system/showfiles) - allows you to set up your show, and get under the hood of your **transform**.engine.

### Connecting to your **transform**.engine.

With the IP address of your **transform**.engine already configured, ensure your personal computer running the **transform**.client software, and any other Dante enabled devices are in the same network subnet.

Launch the **transform**.client, and select 'Connect to new device', input the IP address of your **transform**.engine, select 'Connect'.

And voila, you're in!

:::warning

Please note that at this time, the **transform**.client must be connected by either a static or DHCP IP address - **not link-local**; see [known issue TF-1686](../known-issues).
This will be resolved in a future release.

:::

### Multiple Clients

Multiple users on different devices can connect to the same **transform**.engine and make edits to different plugins at the same time.

It is also possible to run multiple instances of **transform**.client on the same computer. Perfect for example, if you would like to have one instance of a plugin always open on your Master bus, whilst having another instance of the software to scroll freely between your chains, jumping from plugin to plugin!
