# transform.engine v1.0.1 release notes

- **Engine Version**: `1.0.0`
- **Windows Client Version**: `1.0.1`
- **macOS Client Version**: `1.0.1`

## New In This Release

This is a bugfix patch release; for details of the newest features, see [v1.0.0](v1-0-0)!

## Bugs Fixed In This Release

1. **TF-1682: Engines running release `v0.0.9`, `v0.0.10` fail to offer upgrade automatically**

   We discovered that devices which left the factory running certain older versions could fail to
   offer the upgrade to the user when using the `v1.0.0` client, resulting in the system upgrade
   not being possible and the system not functioning correctly. This release fixes this so the
   upgrade is offered to all users when necessary.

We recommend that all users upgrade to this release.

## Compatibility Changes

This release introduces no compatibility changes: **transform**.client `v1.0.1` is fully compatible
with **transform**.engine `v1.0.0`.

## Known Issues

Users should be aware of the following [known issues](../manual/known-issues) in this release, which we hope to address in a future update:

- TF-944: Dante Secondary interface is only operational when using DHCP or Static IP addressing
- TF-1345: Chain metering freezes whilst that chain restarts
- TF-1673: Engine service status indicators are occasionally inaccurate
- TF-1686: Connecting the client to the **transform**.engine using a link-local address results in the client not functioning as expected
- TF-1696: Certain plugins may lead to incorrectly excessive DSP load being displayed

A small number of plugins may experience compatibility issues running on transform.engine.
