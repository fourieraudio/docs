# transform.engine v1.0.0 release notes

- **Engine Version**: `1.0.0`
- **Windows Client Version**: `1.0.0`
- **macOS Client Version**: `1.0.0`

## New In This Release

- Everything! 🎉
- **transform**.engine is your ultimate live plugin host: low-latency, high reliability, and versatile network control.
- ⚡ **Powerful**: Run VST3 plugins in up to 64 chains at down to 1 ms latency over Dante.
- 🌐 **Networked**: Control plugins over the network from macOS or Windows - even over WiFi! Disconnect your computer and transform.engine keeps running independently.
- 💪 **Robust**: Plugin crash isolation: if one chain crashes, the system recovers automatically. Other chains are unaffected.
- 🤯 **Flexible**: Control one transform.engine from multiple clients simultaneously over the network.
- ⏳ **Precise**: Automatically time-align chains with plugin latency compensation.
- 🔒 **Secure**: The Windows plugin hosting environment is never connected to the network.
- ✨ **Efficient**: One-click reset of the Windows plugin hosting environment keeps it pristine for years to come.

## Known Issues

Users should be aware of the following [known issues](../manual/known-issues) in this release, which we hope to address in a future update:

- TF-944: Dante Secondary interface is only operational when using DHCP or Static IP addressing
- TF-1345: Chain metering freezes whilst that chain restarts
- TF-1673: Connecting the client to the **transform**.engine using a link-local address results in the client not functioning as expected
