### What will I need in order to get started with the **transform**.engine?

You will need:

- A **transform**.engine (:wink:)
- One or more Dante-enabled devices to patch the engine to
- A computer to run the Transform control software, running either Windows (10 upwards) or macOS (11 upwards).

### How can I buy a **transform**.engine?

### How can I configure the **transform**.engine?

You can control the **transform**.engine with a computer running either Windows (10 upwards) or macOS (11 upwards), using the Transform control application. Once you're up and running, the **transform**.engine doesn't require the computer to stay connected to continue processing using your configuration!

### What plugins can I run?

The **transform**.engine supports Windows VST3 plugins that can be installed and activated offline.
For more info see our [plugin compatibility database](/plugin-database).

### How many plugins can I run?

How long is a piece of string? No two plugins are alike, so the number of plugins you can run will depend on the DSP load presented by each plugin. We don't limit the number of plugins you can run on a **transform**.engine beyond the amount of raw DSP available.

The **transform**.client application provides real-time feedback on the current DSP load, providing a live indication of how many more plugins you can add before your run out of processing.

### Does the **transform**.engine application work with Apple M1 computers?

Yes it does! M1 computers are supported.

### How many channels can the **transform**.engine process?

The **transform**.engine has 64 channels of Dante input and 64 channels of Dante output. These can be freely assigned to chains as required. They can run at up to 96 kHz.
