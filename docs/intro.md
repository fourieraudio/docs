# Welcome!

Welcome to the Fourier Audio online documentation. This site is the reference manual
for all Fourier Audio products, kept up-to-date with each new release.

## An Interactive Experienceâ„¢
This documentation is maintained in an online [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fourieraudio/docs),
so in the (naturally, incredibly unlikely) instance you find anything that could be improved,
you can ~~complain violently~~ make a suggestion in a GitHub issue, or, even better,
submit a pull request to improve the state of the world for yourself!  Fun for all the family!

## Support
We're on hand to help if you have any issues using a Fourier Audio product. Our support desk can be
reached via e-mail:

## Approaching 88mph...
Are you mind-bendingly irritated at the tools you use on a daily basis? Do you spend your life
re-configuring a bewildering array of systems that seem to secretly hate you? Is it no longer a
secret and have you been entrapped by an angry armada of audio automata? Operators are standing by to
take your call! We're building the future of live audio processing, and would love to hear from you
if you have any *wild ideas that just might work*...
