### What plugins can I run?

The **transform**.engine supports all Windows VST3 plugins, that can be installed and activated offline.

### How many plugins can I run?

How long is a piece of string? No two plugins are alike, so the number of plugins you can run will depend on the DSP load presented by each plugin. We don't limit the number of plugins you can run on a **transform**.engine beyond the amount of raw DSP available.

The Transform application provides real-time feedback on the current DSP load, providing a live indication of how many more plugins you can add before your run out of processing.
