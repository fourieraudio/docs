# Introduction

** *Rewind* gives live mix engineers the ability to time travel.**

Whilst mixing, if an engineer wants to listen back to the history of an audio feed, they need to
implement a full multi-track recording system, often with significant cost and infrastructure
requirements - and a multitrack can't provide quick and simple real-time rewind functionality.

*Rewind* enables engineers to drill into their mix in-the-moment, unleashing the power to fix issues
which previously were lost to the past. With integration solutions for all major mixing consoles,
the solo button now has a flux capacitor.

** 88mph, here we come. **
