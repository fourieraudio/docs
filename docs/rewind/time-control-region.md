# Time Control Region
![Time Control Region](/img/rewind/overview-transport.png)

Here you can see the engineer has wound back the time, and is listening to some audio (as it was
played into the system 42 seconds ago), in this case, the truly exquisite *Kind Of Blue - Miles
Davis*. What excellent taste.

* **Time Travel Indicator**: The large screen at the top shows the distance you've gone back in
  time. Going too far may cause excessive flux in the space-time continuum, which may annoy the LD.

* **Large Knob**: The large knob can be used to fine-tune the amount of time-travel you'd like. Wind
  the knob back to go back in time.

* **Output PPL Meters**: You can see from the meters that the signal is quite hot, and there's
  something quite a lot louder on the right channel. A particularly delicious saxophone solo, as it
  happens.

  For the people who like to get excited about meters, you'll be incredibly excited to know that the
  meters are fully compliant with [IEC 60268-18:1995](https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/1217). For
  everyone else, they go up and down. The top -6 dBFS are indicated in orange, and there's a red
  clip indicator at the top which lights up if any sample reaches 0 dBFS. There are also nice peak
  indicators.

* **Time Travel Buttons** ![Time Travel Buttons](/img/rewind/ui-jump-time-travel.png): As the
  Pointer Sisters almost said, these buttons allow you to *Jump (For Time Travel)*. 30 or 5 seconds
  at a time, these allow you to quickly run back on big or small problems at your leisure.

* **Jump Live Button** ![Jump Live Button](/img/rewind/ui-jump-live.png): This button allows you to
  jump directly to the live audio.

* **Clear Selection Button** ![Clear Selection Button](/img/rewind/ui-clear-sel.png): Press this
  button if you've had enough of whatever you were listening to. It will be deselected and the sound
  will stop (within *Rewind* - we unfortunately do not have the power to affect whatever may be happening on stage.
  Yet.)
