# Licensing

Rewind is available in three different editions, which differ only in the number of channels they
can process:

| Edition | Channels |
|---------|----------|
| Personal | 16 |
| Professional | 32 |
| Production | 128 (wow!) |

To protect your investment, guard against intellectual property theft, and safeguard our
R&D for the future, we use the *iLok* dongle system to license Rewind. You will need an iLok 2 or
iLok 3 to run *Rewind*.

We chose *iLok* because we know many engineers will have one already, but if you don't, they can be
obtained cheaply from your favourite rainforest-related eCommerce provider, or alternatively
*Fourier Audio* can provide pre-licensed dongles ready for use.

The first time you start *Fourier Rewind*, you'll be prompted to insert your *iLok* and
enter your activation code to obtain your licence. After that, you should never need to think about
it ever again; the licence simply lives on your *iLok*.

All three editions run via the same *Rewind* application; if you find you need more channels, simply
upgrade your licence - mid-gig if necessary! Upgrade pricing [is
available](mailto:hello@fourieraudio.com).
