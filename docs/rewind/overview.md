# Overview

So, what have we here? The interface is split into two keys parts:
1. At the **top**, the [Time Control Region](time-control-region),
1. and at the **bottom**, the [Channel Selection Region](channel-selection-region).

In the top right-hand corner there are two buttons that open:

1. ![Configuration Pane](/img/rewind/ui-cog.png) The [configuration pane](configuration-pane).
1. ![Edit Pane](/img/rewind/ui-edit-pencil.png) The [channel edit pane](channel-edit-pane).

In the application **File menu**, you'll find options to allow you to load and save your
[showfile](showfiles), as well as to quit *Rewind* (but why would you want to do that?).
