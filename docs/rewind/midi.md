# MIDI

The *lingua franca* of inter-device communication, *of course* we speak MIDI! <small>(And OSC support is
coming very soon...)</small>

Rewind will detect any *Core Audio* MIDI device present when it starts and can use it
to select and deselect channels and to scroll or jump time forwards or backwards.
Our customers use this to keep hands on control of their time travel, right next to their faders.

Contact [support](mailto:support@fourieraudio.com) for more details on the MIDI maps supported as
we want to ensure your integration works as well as it possibly can.
