# Showfiles

Your channel and user configuration is stored in a **showfile**, which is simply a `.rewind` file
that you can save and load via the File menu.

*Rewind* will automatically save and load your showfile on shutdown and startup, but this provides a
useful mechanism for you to switch between configurations quickly and easily.

Showfiles from old versions of *Rewind* can always be loaded into newer versions. You can also load
showfiles from newer versions of *Rewind* into older versions, but obviously any features added
since won't magically appear (our time travel is good but we're not magicians!).
